Mountain Bike World Cup ETL and Race Analysis with Tableau

In this process, I Extract data from the PDF using Microsoft Power Query’s extract from PDF function. Then, I Transform the data into a more readable and usable format using a series of data manipulation techniques. After that, I load the data into Tableau and visualize the data in two different charts, a line chart “race”, and the overall time differences in seconds from the winner.
